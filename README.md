# Welcome! 

Here are a few examples of method chaining with jQuery. This is part of the Interactive Frontend Development Module for CodeInstitute.

The code uses boilerplate html/css files provided by CodeInstitute.

The 3rd method chaining challenge has been lightly extended to make it clearer: 

- A secondary ID has been added to the second button and second paragraph and a secondary transition attached to the click event for the second button.
